    <!-- Paragraphs describe myself, my major, and what my dream job would be -->
    <p>My name is Benjamin Mitchell, and I'm a sophomore at NC State University studying Business Administration
	with a concentration in Information Systems. I have always found computers and their integration into society,
	particularly within the business environment, interesting. I also enjoy miscellaneous things about computers, whether it be 
	building them or how the internet integrates into different devices which has also helped spur my interest in that area of 
	study.
	</p>    
	<br/>
	
	<p>My current job is as a full-time student, however my dream job would be in Technical Sales at a technology company.
	This would entail being within the sales department assisting with the sale of products, but instead of reaching out and 
	forming the customer relations salespeople do, I would help more with the technical questions about the product the customer
	may have. I think this would allow me to enjoy talking and forming relationships with people while still getting to handle 
	computers and the things I find interesting, hence why it's my dream job.
