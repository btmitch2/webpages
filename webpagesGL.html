	<!-- A paragraph about myself -->
		<p>My name is Benjamin Mitchell, I'm <em>currently</em> a student at NC State University studying business
		administration. I am the <ins>middle</ins> in a family of 5. I have an older brother who goes to ECU, and a younger sister who goes to Appalachian State University, 
		and two parents. I moved to North Carolina about 6-7 years ago and since then I've lived in the town
		of Clayton, about 30 minutes from the city of Raleigh. In my free time I enjoy <strong>crafting stories</strong> and playing Dungeons and Dragons, 
		reading, and hanging out with friends.
